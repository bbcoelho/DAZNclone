# DAZNclone
Digitalinnovation.one bootcamp exercise

In this task we were shown how to clone Netflix home page (using html5, CSS3 and JavaScript), and we were supposed to re-do it our way. But I`ll clone DAZN home page (https://www.dazn.com/en-BR/home) instead of Netflix`s just to make it more challenger.
